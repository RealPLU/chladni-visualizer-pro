Â Chladni Cymatic Visualizer ProAn interactive web application for visualizing the intricate nodal patterns of sound vibrations on various surfaces. This project serves as an educational tool and a creative platform, bringing the physics of cymatics to life in your browser.A real Chladni pattern created with sand, demonstrating the same principles this application simulates.FeaturesReal-time Visualization: See Chladni patterns form instantly as you adjust parameters.Multiple Plate Shapes: Explore patterns on Square, Circular, Rectangular, Triangular, and Hexagonal plates.Interactive Controls:Full control over frequency with manual input, sliders, and fine-tuning.Direct (m,n) mode input for precise pattern generation.Functional material properties (Stiffness & Density) that affect resonant frequencies.3D view controls (zoom, pan, rotate) for observing patterns from any angle.Frequency Sweep: Animate the transition between frequencies to watch patterns evolve.Pattern Gallery: Browse a curated collection of beautiful patterns and load them instantly.Visual Overlays: Toggle helpful guides like symmetry lines and antinode markers to better understand the physics.Parameter Locking: Lock specific settings in "Discovery Mode" to randomize only the parameters you want to explore.Technologies UsedFrontend: HTML5, CSS3 with Tailwind CSSVisualization: Three.js (WebGL) for 3D rendering.Audio: Web Audio API for real-time sine wave generation.Core Logic: Vanilla JavaScriptHow to RunSimply open the chladni_visualizer_pro_v1.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
